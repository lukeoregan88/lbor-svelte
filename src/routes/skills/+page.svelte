          <p>
            For the past decade since Adobe Flash, CSS 1.0 and HTML 4.01 I've
            honed my skills as a developer. I've worked remotely for agencies,
            offered consultancy to startups, and partnered with skilled
            professionals to bring web products to life for both businesses and
            consumers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My specialty lies in front-end development, where I excel in
            creating fast, user-friendly, and best-practice websites using HTML,
            CSS, JS, and coding interactive layouts. I also have expertise in
            building small to medium-sized web applications, custom plugins,
            features, and animations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to front-end development, I have full-stack experience
            with open-source CMS's. I primarily work with WordPress and Apache
            webservers but know my way around many others. I am also constantly
            expanding my knowledge and working with new technologies such as
            Node, Next, React, Gatsby, and Svelte. (did I mention this site is
            built In Svelte? and I love it! <a
